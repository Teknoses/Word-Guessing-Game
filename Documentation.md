## What is it
This is a game designed like hangman -or the more appropriate snowman. This game played in either single-player or multiplayer, from 1-4 players / teams. The game will have a point system that players can use to see their progress and / or determine a winner. The game will include different gamemodes for players such as first grader, math, etc. The game is turn-based with multiple rounds; each round will have a cycle of all the player(s) in random order, guessing a randomly selected word from the same category. Each word will have a difficulty and will award different amounts of points depending on the letters guessed and the length of the word. Guessing the wrong letter will lose you a life, losing all your lives will cause your turn to end and indicate the next team's turn. Guessing the entire word will also cause your turn to end. Once all players have had their turn, a new round will begin. If a player manages to guess a word without any lives lost, then they are awarded a spin; the spin will award either a bonus to you or a sabotage to a selected opponent. The game will end when all the rounds have ended.
